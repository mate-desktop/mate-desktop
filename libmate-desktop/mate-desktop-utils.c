/**
 * mate_desktop_prepend_terminal_to_vector:
 * @argc: a pointer to the vector size
 * @argv: a pointer to the vector
 *
 * Description:  Prepends a terminal (either the one configured as default in
 * the user's MATE setup, or one of the common xterm emulators) to the passed
 * in vector, modifying it in the process.  The vector should be allocated with
 * #g_malloc, as this will #g_free the original vector.  Also all elements must
 * have been allocated separately.  That is the standard glib/MATE way of
 * doing vectors however.  If the integer that @argc points to is negative, the
 * size will first be computed.  Also note that passing in pointers to a vector
 * that is empty, will just create a new vector for you.
