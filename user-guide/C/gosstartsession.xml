    <para>A <firstterm>session</firstterm> is the period of time you spend using MATE, between logging in and logging out. During a session, you use your applications, print, browse the web, and so on.</para>
    <para>Logging in to MATE begins your session. The login screen is your gateway to the MATE Desktop: it is where you enter your username and password and select options such as the language you want MATE to use for your session.</para>

    Normally, logging out ends the session, but you can choose to save the state of your session and restore it next time you use MATE: see <xref linkend="gosstartsession-2"/>.</para></tip>
