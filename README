mate-desktop
=============

mate-desktop contains the libmate-desktop library, the mate-about
program as well as some desktop-wide documents.

The libmate-desktop library provides API shared by several applications
on the desktop, but that cannot live in the platform for various
reasons. There is no API or ABI guarantee, although we are doing our
best to provide stability. Documentation for the API is available with
gtk-doc.

The mate-about program helps find which version of MATE is installed.

You may download updates to the package from:

   http://pub.mate-desktop.org/releases/


Installation
============

If you are not using a released version of mate-desktop (for example,
if you checked out the code from git), you first need to run
'./autogen.sh'.
